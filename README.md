## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd dumbo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in your environment variables:

   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase database**

   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the migrations in the `supabase/migrations` folder
   - Enable the `vector` extension in your Supabase database

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Web app: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Extension development: Load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome

## üîß Chrome Extension Installation

### Option 1: Using Pre-built Extension (Recommended)

If you have the `dist.zip` file, follow these detailed steps to install the Chrome extension:

#### Step 1: Extract the Extension Files

1. **Locate the `dist.zip` file** in your project directory
2. **Right-click** on `dist.zip` and select **"Extract All..."** (Windows) or **"Open With > Archive Utility"** (Mac)
3. **Choose a location** to extract the files (e.g., your Desktop or Documents folder)
4. **Remember the path** to the extracted `dist` folder - you'll need it in the next steps

#### Step 2: Enable Chrome Developer Mode

1. **Open Google Chrome** on your computer
2. **Navigate to the Extensions page** by typing `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and pressing Enter
   - Alternatively, click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí **More tools** ‚Üí **Extensions**
3. **Enable Developer mode** by clicking the toggle switch in the top-right corner of the Extensions page
   - The toggle should turn blue when enabled
   - You'll see new buttons appear: "Load unpacked", "Pack extension", and "Update"

#### Step 3: Load the Extension

1. **Click the "Load unpacked" button** that appeared after enabling Developer mode
2. **Navigate to the extracted `dist` folder** using the file browser that opens
3. **Select the `dist` folder** (not the files inside it, but the folder itself)
4. **Click "Select Folder"** (Windows) or **"Open"** (Mac)

#### Step 4: Verify Installation

1. **Check the Extensions page** - you should see "Extendo Dumbo" listed with a toggle switch
2. **Ensure the extension is enabled** - the toggle should be blue/on
3. **Look for the extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar (it may be hidden in the extensions menu)

#### Step 5: Pin the Extension (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Click the puzzle piece icon** (üß©) in the Chrome toolbar to open the extensions menu
2. **Find "Extendo Dumbo"** in the list
3. **Click the pin icon** (üìå) next to it to pin it to your toolbar for easy access

#### Step 6: Test the Extension

1. **Click the Extendo Dumbo icon** in your toolbar to open the side panel
2. **Try the keyboard shortcuts**:
   - **Ctrl+K** (or **Cmd+K** on Mac): Toggle the side panel
   - **Ctrl+J** (or **Cmd+J** on Mac): Save the current page to a context
3. **Sign in** with your account credentials
4. **Create a context** and start chatting with your AI assistant

### Option 2: Building from Source

If you want to build the extension yourself:

1. **Build the extension**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Follow steps 2-6 from Option 1** using the newly created `dist` folder

### Troubleshooting Extension Installation

#### Common Issues and Solutions:

**"This extension may have been corrupted" error:**
- Make sure you selected the `dist` folder, not individual files
- Try extracting the zip file again to a different location
- Ensure all files were extracted properly

**Extension doesn't appear in the toolbar:**
- Check if it's hidden in the extensions menu (puzzle piece icon)
- Make sure the extension is enabled on the Extensions page
- Try refreshing the Extensions page and reloading the extension

**Keyboard shortcuts don't work:**
- Check if other extensions are using the same shortcuts
- Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` to view and modify keyboard shortcuts
- Make sure you're on a regular webpage (shortcuts don't work on Chrome's internal pages)

**Side panel doesn't open:**
- Make sure you're using Chrome version 114 or later (side panel feature requirement)
- Try clicking the extension icon directly instead of using keyboard shortcuts
- Check the browser console for any error messages

**Authentication issues:**
- Ensure your `.env` file has the correct Supabase credentials
- Check that the Supabase project is properly configured
- Verify that the extension has internet access

#### Getting Help:

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check the browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) for error messages
2. **Visit the Extensions page** (`chrome://extensions/`) and look for error messages
3. **Try disabling and re-enabling** the extension
4. **Reload the extension** by clicking the refresh icon on the Extensions page
